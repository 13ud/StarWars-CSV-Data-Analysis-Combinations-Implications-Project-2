# StarWars-CSV-Data-Analysis-Combinations-Implications-Project-2

    ~ Overview ~
Automated data analysis and machine learning plays a key part in modern information technology. Machine learning helps
to discover patterns and find correlations in our data. In the FoC course, we would like to introduce a rule-based approach
to pattern extraction, namely, association rules. Association rules are often used in market basket analysis to find out
products that are typically bought together. This can be used to physically re-arrange the products to increase their
sales or, in the case of online stores, make recommendations. For instance, "bread" and "butter" are often bought
together with "cheese". How would you discover such associations? What metrics should be used?
In this project, we will introduce some popular approaches to address this problem.


Personal Comment: 
In Project 2 I built a system that is capable of finding associations between various features in a dataset.
The dataset is based on the Star Wars episodes and contains data records with planets and species inhabiting them.
Then I applied my system to find some statistically evident associations (namely, implications) between
characteristics of planets and species inhabiting those planets.
